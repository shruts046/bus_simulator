**BUS NETWORK SIMULATION PROJECT**

The Bus Network Simulation project is a Java-based application that models and visualizes a bus transportation network. This project aims to simulate bus movements, visualize routes, and manage network layouts.

**Project Structure**
Author.java: Contains information about the authors or contributors of the project.
Bus.java: Defines the Bus class with attributes and methods to handle bus operations.
RoadMap.java: Manages the road network, including routes, connectivity, and other map-related functionalities.
BusPanel.java: A graphical user interface component for displaying bus information.
BusVisualizer.java: Responsible for visualizing the bus network, including routes and bus movements.
.project: Configuration file for the project, used by IDEs for project settings.

**Functionality**

Bus Operations: Simulation and management of bus behaviors and attributes.
Network Management: Handling the road network layout, including route planning and connectivity.
Visualization: Graphical representation of the bus network and real-time simulation of bus movements.
User Interface: Interactive components for users to view and manage the bus network.

**How to Set Up**

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java installed on your system. This application requires Java [specify version].
Open the project using a Java-compatible IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

**How to Run**

Navigate to the main class (potentially BusVisualizer.java) and run the application through the IDE.
Interact with the graphical interface to simulate and visualize the bus network.
